Graduate certificate seeking students must submit their Graduate Certificate Completion Form to the Office of Graduate 
Certificates by the deadline to apply for graduation (the fourth week) of the semester in which they will complete the final 
course(s) for their graduate certificate.  Please consult the Academic Calendar  for graduation application deadlines. 
• For Graduate Certificate Seeking Students concurrently enrolled in a graduate degree, the student must be admitted 
into the graduate certificate prior to conferring their concurrent graduate degree.   
• For all Graduate Certificate Seeking Students, a Completion Form must be submitted no later than five years after 
starting the first course applied to the graduate certificate.  
All students must be active at the time the Graduate Certificate Completion Form is submitted.    
The department/school offering the graduate certificate will certify the student for the graduate certificate once the 
requirements are successfully completed. The Graduate Certificate Completion Form is approved by the department/school, 
college, and Office of Graduate Studies. Courses may not be applied to a graduate certificate once the degree is conferred, 
unless an approved application for the graduate certificate is on file before the last day of  classes in the semester when the 
graduate degree is conferred.
