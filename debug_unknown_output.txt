Department: Dean's Office  
Major Contacts, Deadlines, and Delivery Information 
  
The Ph.D. in Big Data Analytics is an interdisciplinary area of scientific methods, processes and systems to extract 
knowledge and insight from large, diverse data sets that include structured, semi -structured and unstructured data, from 
different sources, and in different sizes.  This interdisciplinary major comprises faculty from Artificial Intelligence, Computer 
Science, Engineering, Business, Arts and Sciences, Public Health, and other areas.   Students in the program will develop 
broad theoretical and applied skills, including how to design, implement, and evaluate information -focused big data 
technologies that support decision-making across social and organizational contexts. 
Major Research Areas: 
Big Data, Data Analytics, Data Mining, Database Management, Statistical Computing, Ethics and Human Factors, Artificial 
Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Experiment Design  
Admission Information 
Must meet University Admission and English Proficiency requirements as well as requirements for admission to the major, 
listed below. 
• Three letters of recommendation 
• Personal statement of purpose/interest 
• Resume/CV 
• PDF of unofficial or official transcripts 
• PDF of English proficiency, if needed 
• Master's degree in a relevant area preferred
