A rtificial Intelligence, M .S .A .I.  
Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Computing (AI)  
Department of Artificial Intelligencer, Cybersecurity, and Computing  
Major Contacts, Deadlines, and Delivery Information 
  
This major shares a core with the Cybersecurity, M.S.C.Y.S.  
The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (M.S.A.I.) provides comprehensive training in foundational computer 
science and artificial intelligence concepts while emphasizing practical applications and real -world problem-solving. Designed 
specifically for students without an undergraduate degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering, the program equips 
graduates with the technical skills necessary to transition into AI-focused roles across various industries. The M.S.A.I. is 
available in both in-person and online formats, offering flexibility to accommodate diverse learning needs. Due to the 
interdisciplinary nature of AI and the diverse applications it encompasses, students are encouraged to work closely with the 
Graduate Director to develop a cohesive plan of study tailored to their individual goals. Applicants with prior computing 
backgrounds are advised to consider the M.S. in Computer Science program or the AI Graduate Certificate for a more 
advanced pathway. 
Major Research Areas: 
Machine learning (ML), neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics and 
autonomous systems, knowledge representation and reasoning, ethics and policy in AI, AI tools and frameworks, AI in 
healthcare, finance, education, marketing, and other industries
